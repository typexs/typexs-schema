*Properties*

* type - Datatype of the property
* targetClass - Class of the property objects
* auto - Auto-generated primary key
* id - Primary key
* direct - skip join table generation, keep join id/pks in the table
* name - change property name for the storage (complex pks are prefixes)
* depth - on entity property than level
* idKey - member of object to be used as referencing key, use when direct = true
* readonly - use property only for FindOp and not for SaveOp or DeleteOp.


When property refers to an entity then abort condition must at some level
break the fetching (circular references or very very interleaved).

* by level depth
* by source entity
